## Ticketing Application for Bus Reservations, Flights, and Events in Burkina Faso (West Africa)

### Overview

This project is dedicated to developing a s ticketing application specifically for Burkina Faso, a region with limited access to such digital services. The application will enable efficient and user-friendly booking of bus tickets, flights, and event tickets, integrating advanced machine learning technologies to enhance user experience and operational efficiency.

#### Machine Learning Components

The application will incorporate four key ML models:
1. Recommendation System

    Purpose: To offer personalized event, flight, and bus journey recommendations based on individual user preferences and historical behaviors.
    Data Sources: User interaction data, flight schedules, bus routes, event details.
    Techniques: Utilizing methods like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a combination of both.

2. Customer Support Chatbot

    Purpose: To assist users with inquiries related to bookings, provide information about services, and offer troubleshooting assistance.
    Data Sources: Existing customer service logs, scripted dialogues, online FAQs.
    Techniques: Implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sequence-to-sequence models.

3. Fraud Detection

    Purpose: To detect and prevent fraudulent transactions within the app.
    Data Sources: Financial transaction datasets, synthetically generated data representing fraudulent scenarios.
    Techniques: Employing anomaly detection algorithms and supervised learning models.

4. Sentiment Analysis

    Purpose: To analyze and understand customer feedback, reviews, and sentiments for service improvement.
    Data Sources: Online reviews, social media data, customer feedback submissions.
    Techniques: Leveraging NLP, opinion mining, and text analysis methods.

#### Project Goals

    - Local Relevance: Customizing the app to suit the specific needs and preferences of the Burkinabe population.
    - Technological Empowerment: Introducing cutting-edge digital solutions to a market where such - innovations are not widespread.
    - Enhanced Accessibility: Making the process of booking buses, flights, and event tickets more accessible, intuitive, and user-friendly.

#### Technology Stack

    - Backend: Python and PyTorch for ML model development, Flask or Django for API construction.
    - Frontend: React or Angular for the web application interface, Swift or Kotlin for mobile app development.
    - Database: Employing SQL or NoSQL databases for efficient data storage and management.
    Cloud Services: Utilizing Google Cloud Platform for deploying models and hosting the application.
MVP1 Details
## 1. Frontend Development (React)

    Home Page:
        Objective: Display a list of events.
        Features:
            List events with basic details like name, date, and a brief description.
            Minimalistic and user-friendly design.
    User Registration Page:
        Objective: Allow new users to create an account.
        Features:
            Form fields for username, email, and password.
            Validation checks for form inputs.
            Feedback to users upon successful registration or errors.

## 2. Backend Development (Python)

    Event Listing API:
        Functionality: Retrieve a list of events from the database and send them to the frontend.
        Data Handling: Fetch event details like name, date, and description from the database.
    User Registration API:
        Functionality: Handle user registration requests.
        Data Handling: Store user credentials in the database.
        Security Considerations: Ensure password encryption and validation.

## 3. Database (MySQL)

    Events Table:
        Columns: Event ID, name, date, description, etc.
        Functionality: Store and manage event data.
    Users Table:
        Columns: User ID, username, email, hashed password, etc.
        Functionality: Store and manage user credentials and profile information.

## 4. Integrations and Functionalities

    Database Integration:
        Connect your Python backend with MySQL.
        Use an ORM (like SQLAlchemy) for database interactions.
    User Authentication:
        Initially, focus on user registration.
        Implement secure password handling (use hashing and salting).

## 5. Testing

    Unit Testing:
        Write tests for API functionalities.
        Test database models and interactions.
    Frontend Testing:
        Test the UI components for rendering and user interactions.

## 6. Deployment and Hosting

    Local Deployment:
        Initially, deploy the application locally for testing.
    Considerations for Future Hosting:
        Research hosting options (like Heroku, AWS) for later stages.

## 7. User Interface and Experience

    Design:
        Keep the design simple and intuitive.
        Ensure mobile responsiveness.

## 8. Feedback Mechanism

    Even in MVP1, we will consider how to collect user feedback for future improvements.

## 9. Documentation

    Document the setup, API endpoints, and database schema for future reference and scaling.
