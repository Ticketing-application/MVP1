MVP1 Details
## 1. Frontend Development (React)

    Home Page:
        Objective: Display a list of events.
        Features:
            List events with basic details like name, date, and a brief description.
            Minimalistic and user-friendly design.
    User Registration Page:
        Objective: Allow new users to create an account.
        Features:
            Form fields for username, email, and password.
            Validation checks for form inputs.
            Feedback to users upon successful registration or errors.

## 2. Backend Development (Python)

    Event Listing API:
        Functionality: Retrieve a list of events from the database and send them to the frontend.
        Data Handling: Fetch event details like name, date, and description from the database.
    User Registration API:
        Functionality: Handle user registration requests.
        Data Handling: Store user credentials in the database.
        Security Considerations: Ensure password encryption and validation.

## 3. Database (MySQL)

    Events Table:
        Columns: Event ID, name, date, description, etc.
        Functionality: Store and manage event data.
    Users Table:
        Columns: User ID, username, email, hashed password, etc.
        Functionality: Store and manage user credentials and profile information.

## 4. Integrations and Functionalities

    Database Integration:
        Connect your Python backend with MySQL.
        Use an ORM (like SQLAlchemy) for database interactions.
    User Authentication:
        Initially, focus on user registration.
        Implement secure password handling (use hashing and salting).

## 5. Testing

    Unit Testing:
        Write tests for API functionalities.
        Test database models and interactions.
    Frontend Testing:
        Test the UI components for rendering and user interactions.

## 6. Deployment and Hosting

    Local Deployment:
        Initially, deploy the application locally for testing.
    Considerations for Future Hosting:
        Research hosting options (like Heroku, AWS) for later stages.

## 7. User Interface and Experience

    Design:
        Keep the design simple and intuitive.
        Ensure mobile responsiveness.

## 8. Feedback Mechanism

    Even in MVP1, we will consider how to collect user feedback for future improvements.

## 9. Documentation

    Document the setup, API endpoints, and database schema for future reference and scaling.
